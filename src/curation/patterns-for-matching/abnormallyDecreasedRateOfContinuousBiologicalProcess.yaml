description: "Abnormally decreased rate of a continuous biological process, e.g. rate of an enzyme reaction or growth rate. Does not include decreases in rates of occurrence/frequency. Different to patterns using PATO:0002472 'decreased velocity', which inheres in a physical object (continuant), rather than a process (occurrent)."
