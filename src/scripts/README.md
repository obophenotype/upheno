# Various uPheno related scripts

Generate the _generic pattern matches_, i.e. where the fillers are PATO:quality and owl:Thing:

```
sh pattern_match.sh
```

The patterns are located in src/scripts/pattern-matches-oneoff/patterns, so you could simply add new patterns to that one if you wanted to match something more.
