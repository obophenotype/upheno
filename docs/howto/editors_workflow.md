# Phenotype Ontology Editors' Workflow

1. Identify a group of related phenotypes from diverse organisms
    - consider proposals from phenotype editors, or
    - use the pattern suggestion pipeline
2. Propose a phenotype pattern
    - create a new pull request for the phenotype pattern template in the uPheno github repository
    - propose a logical definition for the pattern
    - document use cases and examples
    - propose a textual definition pattern for the phenotype terms
3. Discuss the new phenotype pattern draft at the regular uPheno phenotype editors meeting
    - collect comments and suggestions for improvements
    - apply suggested improvements
4. Review the candidate phenotype pattern
    - get approval from community members
    - add the ORCIDs of approving phenotype editors to the pattern template
5. Add the community-approved phenotype pattern template to uPheno
    - merge pull request in the github uPheno repository
