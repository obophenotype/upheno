1.  summary Disease Integration

Introduction
============

Our primary focus here is on axiomatization of phenotypes.

Associations between diseases and phenotypes have been curated by Peter
Robinson's group at Charite and by the [PATO] project team members. They
are available from [PhenotypeCommons] and the
[HPO](http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org) website

This project does consist of some preliminary work on axiomatizing
diseases and integrating different disease resources.

See the Monarch Initiative
[disease-miner](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/disease-miner)
repo on github to see the code for building the merged disease ontology

We use the OBO disease ontology (DOID) together with OMIM

The merged ontology is available from:
