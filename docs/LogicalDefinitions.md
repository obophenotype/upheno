1.  summary Phenotype LogicalDefinitions

Introduction
============

"Logical Definitions" is the term we use for definitions expressed in a
logic language such as OWL. For phenotype ontologies, logical
definitions connect phenotypes to classes in multiple [OBO
library](http://obofoundry.org) ontologies.

Details
=======

Logical definitions are expressed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL).
For historic reasons, some of these logical definitions are authored in
OBO-Format, which is a restricted subset of OWL.

See [OWLAxiomatization] for more details
